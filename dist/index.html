            His saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded 
             Apple in his parents’ garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from 
             near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the
              world’s most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform seven industries:
               personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, 
               and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of America’s great innovators, 
               along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but
                long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied 
                imagination to technology and business.

                    One of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of the book,<br>
                 I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on people. “Look at the results,” 
                 he replied. “These are all smart people I work with, and <br>any of them could get a top 
                 job at another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they don’t.” Then he paused 
                 for a few moments and said, almost wistfully, “And we got some amazing things done.” Indeed, he 
                 and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen years that was greater than that of any 
                 other innovative company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, 
                 iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion—not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his
                  final illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had
                   been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife,
                 sister, and four children.
